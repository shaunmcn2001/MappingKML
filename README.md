# Parcel Viewer

This repository contains a small Streamlit application for viewing cadastral parcels.
Users can search for Queensland (QLD) or New South Wales (NSW) parcels by lot and plan, visualize them on a map and export the results as KML or shapefiles.

## Setup

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the tests to make sure everything works:

```bash
pytest
```

## Running the app

Start the Streamlit server and open the parcel viewer in your browser:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
